Well, I know it’s not new year yet; however, i think the sense of “new year” should not be limited by the start of the year. Anytime you can choose to step up and decide on something self productive.

This site is driven by [Markdown Markup] and [AngularJS]. I think i’ll be going fullsteam ahead with [http://blog.mongodb.org/post/49262866911/the-mean-stack-mongodb-expressjs-angularjs-and](MEAN Stack) development.
